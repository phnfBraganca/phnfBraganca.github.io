        <h3>Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising</h3>
        <p>Worked as a Technical Artist. I was very close to the 3D character and animation teams, assisting them in implementing their work into Unity. Besides that, I worked extensively as a generalist, assisting with specific tasks in bosses and HUD implementation.</p>
